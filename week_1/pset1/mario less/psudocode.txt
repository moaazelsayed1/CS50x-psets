we want do-while loop to make sure that getting the integer hsppens at least one time,
and to ignore any invalid value (n must be >=1 and <=8)

the pyramid contains of two kinds of stone
(spaces and hashes)
so we gonna nest two for-loops inside another one
the main for loop is for row
the second is for space, the third is for hashes
we can not nest the space for loop inside the hashes one becouse it does not depend on columns but rows
** we have to get the relation between (i) and (j) and between (i) and (k)
which is
    ***** j<i+1 **** and
    ***** k<(n-1)-i *****
