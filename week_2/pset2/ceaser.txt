    1- recieve the key from the user
    2- recieve the plaintext.
    3- create for loop to encrypts each of the alphabets of the text.
    4- then substitute in the following relationship
        ci = (pi + k) % 26
    5- print out the ciphertext.


      about shifting the ascii code:            (     s[i] = (((s[i] - 65) + key) % 26) + 65;    )

                 we have to shift all uppercases to start from one and end at
                 26 then we could add the key and take the remainder of ddviding
                 it by 26 r(0-25), by adding r to 65 we can access all uppercases
                 depending on the letter s[i].
