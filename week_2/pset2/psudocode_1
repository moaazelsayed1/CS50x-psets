// a programme to indicate the readability of a text:

- we need to know the totl number of the following 
     1-words in the text.
     2-letters in the text.
     3-sentences in the text.
    
- we have to calculate the average per (100 words) of the following
     1- letters (L).
     2- sentences (S).
     
- then we can substitute in the following relationship:  
    
     index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 
     then Approximate (index) to the nearest integer using (0.0f) as a placeholder for it.
